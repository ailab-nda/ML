Very often in machine learning, we'll replace observed data or a complex distributions with a simpler, approximating distribution. KL Divergence helps us to measure just how much information we lose when we choose an approximation, thus we can even use it as our objective function to pick which approximation would work best for the problem at hand.\n",

        "KL Divergence has its origins in information theory. The primary goal of information theory is to quantify how much information is in our data. To recap, one of the most important metric in information theory is called Entropy, which we will denote as $H$ . The entropy for a probability distribution is defined as:\n",

        "If we use  $\\log_2$ for our calculation we can interpret entropy as, using a distribution $p$, the minimum number of bits it would take us to encode events drawn from distribution $p$ . Knowing we have a way to quantify how much information is in our data, we now extend it to quantify how much information is lost when we substitute our observed distribution for a parameterized approximation.\n",

Because we're multiplying the difference between the two distribution with $p(x_i)$, this means that matching areas where the original distribution has a higher probability is more important than areas that has a lower probability. Again, if we think in terms of  $\\log_2$ , we can interpret this as, how many extra bits of information we need to encode events drawn from true distribution $p$, if using an optimal code from distribution $q$ rather than $p$.\n",
